## About this Project

This Landing Page is a description of myself for my portfolio. It's a practice for the use of Flexbox in CSS, as it's my first project with this language.

This project is a task from The Odin Project, a structured full stack development course. You can learn at your own pace and it starts from 0 to getting employed. I highly recommend taking this course.
